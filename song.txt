Conversion, software version 7.0
looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub
eating seeds as a pastime activity
the toxicity of our city, of our city
You, what do you own the world?
how do you own disorder, disorder
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence
Sacred silence and sleep
somewhere, between the sacred silence and sleep
disorder, disorder, disorder
More wood for the fires, loud neighbors
flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck
eating seeds as a pastime activity
the toxicity of our city, of our city
You, what do you own the world?
how do you own disorder, disorder
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence
Sacred silence and sleep
somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
disorder, disorder, disorder
You, what do you own the world?
how do you own disorder, disorder
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence
Sacred silence and sleep
somewhere, between the sacred silence and sleep
disorder, disorder, disorder
When I became the sun
I shone life into the manÂ´s hearts
